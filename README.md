## Spline Concepts

This repository is an early effort to generate visualizations of small plant organs, and the regions where plant organs overlap.

Classical visualization approaches often treat plant organs separately, or operate on cell level with much overhead.

This is an effort to generate a Spline-based description based on CPlantBox to outline splines and describe more complex and fine-granular plant structures.
